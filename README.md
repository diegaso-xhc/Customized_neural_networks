# Customized_neural_networks

## Overview of the repository
<div align="justify">
Neural networks are widely used in recent years. They can be considered the entry point to modern machine and deep learning techniques. This repository aims to providing an easy to use customizable framework for neural networks. With our fully open code, users could have an initial understanding on how neural networks work and build upon this code to execute more sophisticated tasks. This repository is a great alternative for teaching purposes and for training neural networks which can be easily deployed in hardware level, such as microcontrollers after selecting optimal weights and biases. 
<br />
<br />
This repository was developed in MATLAB. It allows users to customize easily a neural network with as many layers and nodes as required. It also keeps of the best combination of weights and biases for testing.

## Understanding repository

The repository was developed using the following software version:

```
- Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS
- Matlab 2023b
```
To run the repository, simply clone this repository and run the main.m file. 
```
./run_code_ubuntu
```

Then a window will be launched where the controllers of your main file will be simulated.

## Contributions

The contributions of this repository can be summarized as follows:

```
- A ready to use panda-arm-robot-hand simulation.
- A simple controller framework so users can implement their controllers.
- In the next couple of months (once our work is published) we will add the algorithms required for motions in real-world.
```
